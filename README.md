Falling Clyde
============

============

Falling Clyde is a game I developed in 2014 and has gone through massive changes.

I'm currently happy with its current build and I'm openly given my source code for those interested
in how the game works or if someone wants to use the code to build their own game. 

The only thing not available are the art assets. You will need to replace the ones from my game with 
your own custom ones. 

Running the game without the art assets will result in the game crashing.

The game is built off an HTML5 Game Engine called ImpactJS. Back in 2014, the engine cost $99 dollars 
and I didn't want to include it in any repo. Sometime in the past year, the engine became free to download along with other examples that helped me understand the engine and helped me build Falling Clyde.

If you are interested in learning more about ImpactJS, Jesse Freeman wrote a great book called 
HTML5 Games with ImpactJS
